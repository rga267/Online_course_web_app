A full online course web application built with Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. You can sign up and enroll in any course and take an exam after reviewing the lessons in each course. Currently only a django course with one lesson and one exam is set up. However, admins/instructors can add more courses, lessons and exams. The app is deployed on IBM Cloud Foundry.
